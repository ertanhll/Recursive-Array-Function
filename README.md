Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to implement and understand recursive array functions in C.

Tasks:

Print Array Function (print_array):

Implement a recursive function called print_array that prints the elements of an integer array recursively.
The function should print each element followed by a space, and a newline character at the end.
Element of Function (is_element_of):

Implement a recursive function called is_element_of that checks if a given integer n is an element of a given integer array.
The function should return 1 if n is found in the array, otherwise return 0.
Use a pointer-based approach to traverse the array recursively.
Count in Array Function (count_in_array):

Implement a recursive function called count_in_array that counts the occurrences of a given integer n in a given integer array.
The function should return the total number of occurrences of n in the array.
Utilize a divide-and-conquer approach to recursively split the array and count occurrences.
Array Copy Function (array_copy):

Implement a recursive function called array_copy that copies elements from one integer array to another.
The function should copy size elements from the source array to the destination array.
Reverse Copy Function (reverse_copy):

Implement a recursive function called reverse_copy that copies elements from one integer array to another in reverse order.
The function should copy size elements from the source array to the destination array in reverse order.
Expected Output:

Test each recursive function with sample inputs and provide the output.
Verify the correctness of each function's implementation with meaningful outputs and explanations.
